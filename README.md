# open-orbitronics
An open-source database and toolkit for discovering sustainable orbitronic materials using orbital angular momentum (OAM) — free from rare metals, built for the post-silicon era.

# 🌌 AetherFoundry

> **Open tools for sustainable post-silicon logic.**

AetherFoundry is a public, open-source initiative to map and build the foundation for **orbitronic microelectronics** — devices and systems based on the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of electrons, not just charge or spin. Our mission is to create the tools, data, and design frameworks necessary to power the next generation of low-impact, rare-metal-free computing.

## 🧭 What This Is
AetherFoundry starts with the first public database and visualization dashboard for **sustainable orbitronic materials**:

- ✅ Earth-abundant element candidates (Cu, Al, C)
- ✅ AI-assisted orbital momentum prediction
- ✅ Community-submitted experimental/theoretical results
- ✅ Sustainability metrics: scarcity, toxicity, energy cost

---

## 🚀 Project Goals
- 📚 **Open Material Repository**: Collect known & predicted orbitronic materials
- 🧠 **AI Tools**: Predict OAM-active compounds from existing structures
- 🌿 **Sustainability Scoring**: Rank materials by eco and geopolitical impact
- 🧪 **Submission Portal**: Invite researchers and makers to contribute
- 🧰 **Toolkit**: Simulators, models, and design guides for DIY Aethermancers

## 🔧 Getting Started
Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aetherfoundry.git
cd aetherfoundry
npm install  # or pip install -r requirements.txt (if Python backend)
```

Start local dev server (TBD depending on frontend/backend stack).
