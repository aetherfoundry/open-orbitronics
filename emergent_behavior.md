 LIBRARY OF POSSIBLE EMERGENT BEHAVIORS
Observables that hint at living logic, memory, or coherence in organic systems

1. Echo Delay
A delayed reappearance of a signal modulation after the original stimulus has ended.

May occur in distinct frequencies, harmonics, or voltage pulses.

Indicates a feedback loop or “ringing” effect within the organic medium.

2. Coherence Spike
A sudden increase in signal uniformity or harmonic structure following input.

FFT shows sharp, repeated peaks across trials.

Suggests momentary entrainment or alignment of microstates.

3. Resonance Coupling
Stimulus in one part of the substrate triggers a reactive signal in a spatially distinct region.

Sensor B activates in synchrony with Sensor A’s stimulation.

Suggests internal energy distribution or communicative linkage.

4. Memory Drift
Baseline measurements gradually shift after repeated exposures.

Subtle impedance or magnetic profile change without immediate cause.

Could point to cumulative internal state—learning or fatigue.

5. Inhibitory Recovery
Suppression of signal response after stimulus, followed by overshoot rebound.

A dip, then a spike—common in biological neurons.

Possible analog of refractory period or adaptive inhibition.

6. Spontaneous Re-Activation
Signal returns without any external trigger, echoing a past state.

Appears after a known prior pattern but without new input.

Suggests latent memory or self-excitation.

7. Noise-to-Order Transitions
Random baseline fluctuations collapse into discernible periodicity during/after stimulation.

Low entropy zones within otherwise chaotic signals.

May indicate phase-locking or micro-scale synchronization.

8. Input-Specific Plasticity
Different stimuli types (light vs. sound vs. electric) result in diverging signal histories.

System forms “preferences” or biases in how it responds.

Like early stages of synaptic pruning or adaptation.

9. Contextual Modulation
A stimulus has different effects depending on past stimulus history.

Same light pulse produces different result based on prior current or tone.

Echoes contextual computing seen in biological organisms.

10. Temporal Hysteresis
System "lags" behind changes, showing slow return to baseline.

Suggests analog computation or energetic charge redistribution.

Behaves more like wet capacitive memory than dry circuits.

11. Cross-Sensory Interference
One form of input (e.g. sound) disrupts or enhances response to another (e.g. light).

Reveals sensitivity to multidimensional input—possible rudimentary fusion.

12. Phase Drift Synchronization
Initially desynchronized sensors gradually begin to phase-lock over time.

Indicates internal harmonics or feedback stabilization.

13. Frequency Jump Events
Abrupt jumps in dominant frequency bands not caused by input.

Can imply internal thresholds or state changes akin to firing patterns.

14. Subharmonic Bursts
Unexpected frequencies appear at half or third of the stimulation rate.

Suggests nonlinear processing or internal modulation layers.

15. Impedance Oscillation
Cyclic changes in resistance/capacitance over time unrelated to hardware noise.

Can reflect structural shifts or organic reconfiguration.

16. Field Memory (Magnetic Lag)
Magnetic readout retains signature of prior field long after it was removed.

Indicates slow relaxation—possibly organic spin-state memory.

17. Stochastic Encoding
Outputs appear random until aligned to a repeating input pattern.

Suggests an internal "code" that only responds to coherent signals.

18. Energetic Thresholding
No response to weak stimulus, then sudden non-linear behavior at threshold.

Reflects emergent activation or system-wide tipping point.

19. Meta-Stable States
System appears to stabilize, then flips to a new output pattern spontaneously.

Mirrors quantum-inspired "state collapse" or switching networks.

20. Frequency Tunneling
Low-energy inputs appear to "pass through" substrate to distant sensors.

Possible indication of conductive resonance or analog tunneling paths.
